* NetworkManager: Handles network instantiation and vigilance.

* NOTE: there is only ONE static instance of NetworkManager (I.E the class is a singleton)

* NOTE ON USAGE: Like the GameManager, ensure the NetworkManager script is located in
* a bare-bones prefab. No loader is required for NetworkManager, GameManger handles
* this process.
